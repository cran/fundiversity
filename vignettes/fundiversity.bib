  abstract = {Quantifying the functional diversity in ecological communities is very promising for both studying the response of diversity to environmental gradients and the effects of diversity on ecosystem functioning (i.e. in "biodiversity experiments"). In our view, the Rao coefficient is a good candidate for an efficient functional diversity index. It is, in fact, a generalization of the Simpson's index of diversity and it can be used with various measures of dissimilarity between species (both those based on a single trait and those based on several traits). However, when intending to quantify the functional diversity, we have to make various methodological decisions such as how many and which traits to use, how to weight them, how to combine traits that are measured at different scales and how to quantify the species' relative abundances in a community. Here we discuss these issues with examples from real plant communities and argue that diversity within a single trait is often the most ecologically relevant information. When using indices based on many traits, we plead for careful a priori selection of ecologically relevant traits, although other options are also feasible. When combining many traits, often with different scales, methods considering the extent of species overlap in trait space can be applied for both the qualitative and quantitative traits. Another possibility proposed here is to decompose the variability of a trait in a community according to the relative effect of among- and within-species differentiation (with the latter not considered by current indices of functional diversity), in a way analogical to decomposition of Sum of squares in ANOVA. Further, we show why the functional diversity is more tightly related to species diversity (measured by Simpson index) when biomass is used as a measure of population abundance, in comparison with frequency. Finally, the general expectation is that functional diversity can be a better predictor of ecosystem functioning than the number of species or the number of functional groups. However, we demonstrate that some of the expectations might be overrated - in particular, the "sampling effect" in biodiversity experiments is not avoided when functional diversity is used as a predictor.},

  abstract = {Aim Functional diversity is a key facet of biodiversity that is increasingly being measured to quantify its changes following disturbance and to understand its effects on ecosystem functioning. Assessing the functional diversity of assemblages based on species traits requires the building of a functional space (dendrogram or multidimensional space) where indices will be computed. However, there is still no consensus on the best method for measuring the quality of functional spaces. Innovation Here we propose a framework for evaluating the quality of a functional space (i.e. the extent to which it is a faithful representation of the initial functional trait values). Using simulated datasets, we analysed the influence of the number and type of functional traits used and of the number of species studied on the identity and quality of the best functional space. We also tested whether the quality of the functional space affects functional diversity patterns in local assemblages, using simulated datasets and a real study case. Main conclusions The quality of functional space strongly varied between situations. Spaces having at least four dimensions had the highest quality, while functional dendrograms and two-dimensional functional spaces always had a low quality. Importantly, we showed that using a poor-quality functional space could led to a biased assessment of functional diversity and false ecological conclusions. Therefore, we advise a pragmatic approach consisting of computing all the possible functional spaces and selecting the most parsimonious one.},

  abstract = {Aim: Species in ecological communities are linked by biotic interactions. It is therefore important to simultaneously study the impacts of global warming on interdependent taxa from different trophic levels. Here, we quantify current and potential future associations of functional diversity (based on multiple traits) and functional identity (based on individual traits) between interacting taxa using projection models under climate change. Location: A tropical elevational gradient (500\textendash 3500 m a.s.l.) in the Man\'u biosphere reserve, southeast Peru Methods: We investigated different scenarios of how species' elevational ranges might change under climate change based on projected future increases in mean annual temperature and current associations of species' elevational ranges with temperature. We computed the functional diversity and identity of current and potential future plant and bird communities based on morphological traits that influence plant-frugivore interactions. Finally, we tested for changes in the associations between projected functional diversity and identity of future plant and bird communities. Results: Projected functional diversity of plants and birds decreased under range contraction and range shift scenarios at low elevations. At mid and high elevations, functional diversity of both species groups increased most strongly under range expansion. Correspondence between plant and bird functional diversity was weakest under range contraction, while it remained strong under range expansion and shift. Similarly, the correspondence of projected plant and bird functional identity was weakest under a range contraction scenario. Main conclusions: Our findings suggest that a scenario in which species are dispersal-limited and sensitive to increasing temperatures is likely to cause a functional mismatch between plant and bird communities along this tropical elevational gradient. This implies that certain functional types of plants could miss avian seed dispersers in the future. Our approach of studying functional diversity of interacting taxa could be more widely applied to identify potential future mismatches between trophic levels.},

  abstract = {Functional diversity is at the heart of current research in the field of conservation biology. Most of the indices that measure diversity depend on variables that have various statistical types (e.g. circular, fuzzy, ordinal) and that go through a matrix of distances among species. We show how to compute such distances from a generalization of Gower's distance, which is dedicated to the treatment of mixed data. We prove Gower's distance can be extended to include new types of data. The impact of this generalization is illustrated on a real data set containing 80 plant species and 13 various traits. Gower's distance allows an efficient treatment of missing data and the inclusion of variable weights. An evaluation of the real contribution of each variable to the mixed distance is proposed. We conclude that such a generalized index will be crucial for analyzing functional diversity at small and large scales.},

  abstract = {Summary Despite efforts in data collection, missing values are commonplace in life-history trait databases. Because these values typically are not missing randomly, the common practice of removing missing data not only reduces sample size, but also introduces bias that can lead to incorrect conclusions. Imputing missing values is a potential solution to this problem. Here, we evaluate the performance of four approaches for estimating missing values in trait databases (K-nearest neighbour (kNN), multivariate imputation by chained equations (mice), missForest and Phylopars), and test whether imputed datasets retain underlying allometric relationships among traits. Starting with a nearly complete trait dataset on the mammalian order Carnivora (using four traits), we artificially removed values so that the percent of missing values ranged from 10\% to 80\%. Using the original values as a reference, we assessed imputation performance using normalized root mean squared error. We also evaluated whether including phylogenetic information improved imputation performance in kNN, mice, and missForest (it is a required input in Phylopars). Finally, we evaluated the extent to which the allometric relationship between two traits (body mass and longevity) was conserved for imputed datasets by looking at the difference (bias) between the slope of the original and the imputed datasets or datasets with missing values removed. Three of the tested approaches (mice, missForest and Phylopars), resulted in qualitatively equivalent imputation performance, and all had significantly lower errors than kNN. Adding phylogenetic information into the imputation algorithms improved estimation of missing values for all tested traits. The allometric relationship between body mass and longevity was conserved when up to 60\% of data were missing, either with or without phylogenetic information, depending on the approach. This relationship was less biased in imputed datasets compared to datasets with missing values removed, especially when more than 30\% of values were missing. Imputations provide valuable alternatives to removing missing observations in trait databases as they produce low errors and retain relationships among traits. Although we must continue to prioritize data collection on species traits, imputations can provide a valuable solution for conducting macroecological and evolutionary studies using life-history trait databases.},

  abstract = {Functional diversity is increasingly identified as an important driver of ecosystem functioning. Various indices have been proposed to measure the functional diversity of a community, but there is still no consensus on which are most suitable. Indeed, none of the existing indices meets all the criteria required for general use. The main criteria are that they must be designed to deal with several traits, take into account abundances, and measure all the facets of functional diversity. Here we propose three indices to quantify each facet of functional diversity for a community with species distributed in a multidimensional functional space: functional richness (volume of the functional space occupied by the community), functional evenness (regularity of the distribution of abundance in this volume), and functional divergence (divergence in the distribution of abundance in this volume). Functional richness is estimated using the existing convex hull volume index. The new functional evenness index is based on the minimum spanning tree which links all the species in the multidimensional functional space. Then this new index quantifies the regularity with which species abundances are distributed along the spanning tree. Functional divergence is measured using a novel index which quantifies how species diverge in their distances (weighted by their abundance) from the center of gravity in the functional space. We show that none of the indices meets all the criteria required for a functional diversity index, but instead we show that the set of three complementary indices meets these criteria. Through simulations of artificial data sets, we demonstrate that functional divergence and functional evenness are independent of species richness and that the three functional diversity indices are independent of each other. Overall, our study suggests that decomposition of functional diversity into its three primary components provides a meaningful framework for its quantification and for the classification of existing functional diversity indices. This decomposition has the potential to shed light on the role of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning and on the influence of biotic and abiotic filters on the structure of species communities. Finally, we propose a general framework for applying these three functional diversity indices.},
