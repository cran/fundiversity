\description{
A dataset containing some functional traits of frugivorous birds in the Man√∫
biosphere reserve, southeast Peru. Given are species mean trait values.
The row names of the dataset give species names. Morphological
traits have been measured on museum specimen following Eck et al.(2011).
Traits have been measured only for adult and, if possible, for a minimum of
two female and two male specimens. Body mass was taken
from Dunning et al. (2007).
