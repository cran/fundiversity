\description{
Taxonomy and functional traits of 392 fleshy-fruited plant species from
the Manu National Park in south-east Peru. Given are fruit length and
width (mm), plant height (m) and crop mass (g). Fruit traits have been
measured on fresh fruit samples. Number of fruits per plant
(used to determine the crop mass) and plant height have been estimated
in the field. Species names are indicated as
row names.
